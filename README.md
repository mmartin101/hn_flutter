# hn_flutter

Hacker News App built with Flutter. Just loads the top stories from /topstories and has a button to refresh the list.
Tapping on a story will open the link in the device's default browser.

Todo:
- Add support for other lists (best, newest, ask hn, jobs, etc)
- Add support for viewing comments
- Filtering (by title, domain, date (not sure))
- animations?
